The BirdControl DBMS database has been of fundamental importance for the $BRI_2$ analysis and for the development and testing of the proposed data-driven model. 
I am also grateful to Magenta s.r.l. and Prof. Andrew D. Bagdanov for the opportunity given, for the workspaces and for the consultancy provided.
Finally, i wish to thank my family and friends for their support and in particular my university colleagues for their enthusiastic encouragement and useful critiques of this thesis work.
